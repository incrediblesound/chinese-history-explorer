				This site is an open-source wiki about Chinese history. You can add to or edit the content by making pull-requests on the <a href="http://github.com/incrediblesound/chinese-history-explorer">source repo </a>on github.

			<p class="description">
				The philosophy behind this site is to provide concise summaries of specific topics in Chinese history. The ideal topic will cut a balance between being too general to be interesting and being bogged down in details. A person should be able to read about a topic and have a good idea about what that topic is, and all complexity within the topic should be broken out into sub-topics.
