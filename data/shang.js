			description: 'The Shang had a complex system of divination '+
				'whereby the king and/or his shamans, who were also nobles, asked for '+
				'guidance from the ancestors or from "god". The questions were inscribed '+
				'into bovine scapula or turtle shells, now called "oracle bones", and a '+
				'heat source was applied to produce cracks. The cracks were interpreted '+
				'and a summary of the divination event was inscribed on the bone. This '+
				'process was gradually simplified of the course of Shang history. At first, a large variety of questions were offered up to the '+
				'higher powers, including topics such as harvest, childbirth, the '+
				'interpretation of dreams, and matters of diplomacy or war. The '+
				'questions were formed in binary pairs which were inscribed in bold '+
				'calligraphy on either side of the bone, and filled in with colorful '+
				'pigment when the divination process was complete. Over time the '+
				'subject matter of divination became narrower, mostly covering requests '+
				'for safety and a plentiful hunt. The calligraphic inscriptions became '+
				'simpler both in style and content, and the interpretations lost their '+
				'depth and variety. This could be due to a greater '+
				'systemization of royal power that relied less on spectacle '+
				'as it became more established, and potentially also because a '+
				'new system of divination was emerging that later became known as the "Zhou Yi", or Yi Ching as it '+
				'is known in the west.'
